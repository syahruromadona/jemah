# Jemah

Jemah is a lightweight tool that converts notes into flashcards using the OpenAI API.

It takes unstructured or semi-structured notes and transforms them into clear, question–answer style flashcards designed for efficient review and spaced repetition. The goal is to reduce the friction between learning and active recall.

**What it does**

* Accepts plain text notes
* Extracts key concepts
* Generates concise, focused flashcards

This is a legacy passion project.
